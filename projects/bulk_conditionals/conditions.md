# Conditions for FreeGene building
In many cases, a DNA part will require certain conditions in order for it to be built. These can only be added to a bulk upload sheet by adding addition columns with specific titles and conditions. There are 7 sections that must be added: "conditions", "vector", "strain", "selection", "media", "temperature", and "notes".

## conditions
- Default: "False"
- Options: ["True"]
This is where in the bulk csv upload file you can state that you would like conditionals to be used. 

## vector
- Default: "default"
- Options: ["pOpen1.0"]
This is where you can put a desired vector. There aren't many options, so check again soon.

## strain
- Default: "strain"
